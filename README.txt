This is a multi-threaded PI calculator that uses Chudnovsky's binary-splitting algorithm. It's written in Java and might need a better math library for integer multiplication before any sort of world-record attempt (currently trillions of PI digits at this writing). It can currently get to 1,000,000 digits of PI in < 10 seconds, although computation gets progressively worse as we scale up higher.
